  "SD-JWT-based Verifiable Digital Credentials — [draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc).

   Composition, not new cryptography: `sd-jwt.core` provides the salted-hash
   mechanism, `jws.core` provides the signature envelope, and this adds the rules
   that make the pair a credential — a type, a set of claims that must never be
   optional, and a holder proof bound to one presentation.

   ## Seven claims that cannot be selectively disclosed

   `iss`, `nbf`, `exp`, `cnf`, `vct`, `vct#integrity`, `status` MUST NOT appear in
   Disclosures. The reason is that each one is load-bearing for the Verifier's own
   decision: a credential whose expiry, issuer, type or revocation pointer could be
   withheld is one the Holder gets to choose the meaning of. `issue` refuses to
   conceal them rather than trusting a caller to remember.

   ## sd_hash covers the presentation, including the trailing tilde

   RFC 9901 §4.3.1: the digest is over \"the US-ASCII bytes of the encoded SD-JWT,
   i.e., the Issuer-signed JWT, a tilde character, and zero or more Disclosures
   selected for presentation, each followed by a tilde character\" — and NOT the
   KB-JWT itself.

   So the hashed string ends with `~`, and omitting it produces a `sd_hash` that
   fails against every other implementation. It is also what binds the proof to
   *this* set of disclosures: a Holder who drops one Disclosure and reuses the
   KB-JWT changes the hashed bytes, which is the whole point.

   ## typ

   `dc+sd-jwt` for the Issuer-signed JWT, `kb+jwt` for the Key Binding JWT. The
   older `vc+sd-jwt` is accepted on verification during the transition the draft
   allows, and never produced."
