;; `kotoba/sd_jwt_vc/verify.kotoba` against `sd-jwt-vc.core/verify`.
;;
;; The slice is the ORDER of refusals that decides whether a presentation
;; may be believed, plus the choice of which bytes the holder's proof must
;; cover. The cryptography, JSON, SHA-256 and base64url stay in the host, as
;; they already do in the oracle.
;;
;; So the two are handed the SAME presentation, built by `sd-jwt-vc.core`
;; itself, and compared on the verdict and the reason for it.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy of the order.
;;
;; ## The host loop
;;
;; `drive` is the deployment: it runs both `jws/verify` calls, decodes the
;; JSON, and computes the `sd_hash` -- over the prefix THE GUEST produced,
;; which is the point of exporting it. Each result reaches the guest as the
;; smallest thing that answers a question: a bool for a signature, a string
;; for a claim, a digest to compare against another digest.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;;   * `the-sd-hash-input-ends-with-a-tilde` — RFC 9901 §4.3.1. Omitting it
;;     produces a digest that fails against every other implementation,
;;     which is a bug that only appears when you talk to somebody else;
;;   * `dropping-a-disclosure-changes-the-hashed-bytes` — the whole purpose
;;     of `sd_hash`: a Holder who presents fewer Disclosures and reuses the
;;     KB-JWT must not be believed;
;;   * `the-kb-jwt-is-not-part-of-what-it-signs` — the other half of
;;     §4.3.1, and a prefix that included it could not be computed by the
;;     signer;
;;   * `cnf-is-required-before-the-kb-jwt-is-looked-at` — §3.2.2. Without
;;     `cnf` there is no key to check the KB-JWT against, and a verifier
;;     that checks it first has already asked a question it had no standing
;;     to ask;
;;   * `an-untyped-token-is-not-a-credential` — RFC 8725.
